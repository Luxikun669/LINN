# LINN: Lightweight Implicit Neural Network for Binaural Audio Synthesis
> **Status:** Under review. We will release code, trained models, and data preparation scripts **upon paper acceptance**.

## 🎧 Audio Demo (GitHub Pages)

> **Please wear headphones.**  
We host interactive audio samples (mono input, ground-truth, and multiple baselines vs. **LINN**) on a separate web page:

👉 **Demo page:** https://<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/LINN/  
(If the link is not live yet, it will be enabled once GitHub Pages is deployed.)

**What you’ll find:**
- Abstract & short intro
- A grid of audio players (Mono / Groundtruth / Baselines / Ours)
- Samples from multiple subsets (walking, music, speech, etc.)


## Overview
This repository will host the official implementation for:
- **Paper:** Lightweight Implicit Neural Network for Binaural Audio Synthesis <ICASSP, 2026> (under review)
- **Authors:** Xikun Lu, Fang Liu, Weizhi Shi, Jinqiu Sang (✉ corresponding)

We plan to open-source:
- [ ] Training & evaluation code    
- [ ] Data preparation / preprocessing scripts  
- [ ] Reproducible configs & logs

## Planned Timeline
- ✅ Repo created: 2025-09-05
- ⏳ Decision / camera-ready: TBA
- 🚀 Code release: TBA
