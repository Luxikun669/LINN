# LINN: Lightweight Implicit Neural Network for Binaural Audio Synthesis
> **Status:** Under review. We will release code, trained models, and data preparation scripts **upon paper acceptance**.

## Overview
This repository will host the official implementation for:
- **Paper:** Lightweight Implicit Neural Network for Binaural Audio Synthesis <ICASSP, 2026> (under review)
- **Authors:** Xikun Lu, Fang Liu, Weizhi Shi, Jinqiu Sang (✉ corresponding)

We plan to open-source:
- [ ] Training & evaluation code    
- [ ] Data preparation / preprocessing scripts  
- [ ] Reproducible configs & logs


## 🎧 Audio Demo (GitHub Pages)

> **Please wear headphones.**  
We host interactive audio samples (mono input, ground-truth, and multiple baselines vs. **LINN**) on a separate web page:

👉 **Demo page:** [https://luxikun669.github.io/LINN/]  

**What you’ll find:**
- Abstract
- A grid of audio players


## Planned Timeline
